 
 In my project I use collection-repeat + infinite-scroll,and dynamic set item-height, when infinite-scroll finished loading, then screen shake and splash, after that the scroll position before I scroll has changed, I can not see the same items after infinite-scroll finished loading.
  I find if all the item is the same height,then It is OK.
 
 
 I refer to follow to make this project,using it's source code to change.
